# draw-guess
## Project Description
draw-guess is a game for two, where one player gets a random word to draw in 30 sec, and the second user needs to guess what the word was based on the drawing. 

test the project here: https://shirinstar.github.io/quick-guess/

## wireframes
Here is the initial thinking of how I started, the idea was to focus on simple and intutive user experience that support such a game.:
