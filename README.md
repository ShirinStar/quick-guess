the idea was to focus on simple and intutive user experience that support such a game.

## MVP
- mobile first game for two players
- player one receives random word
- two separate counters for each of the players
- player one draw with her/his finger/mouse on the canvas
- player two needs to guess the word player one received
- the game check for a match between player two guess's to the random word player one received
